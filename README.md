# CM_to_QIF

I use an opensource software called "Homebank" to keep track of my expenses.
I usually retrieve the list of transactions I've made in the past months from my bank's website (creditmutuel.fr),
which offers a feature to export transactions as a QIF file.
However, Cr√©dit Mutuel's website does not allow to export transactions older than 3 months. Surprisingly, it is still
possible to display transactions up to 6 months old using the "search transaction" feature.
This small python script was created to parse the HTML page where those 6-months-old transactions are displayed, and
export them as a QIF file for Homebank to read.
